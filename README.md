# Nasa Search Engine Technical Test

This is an app designed to retrieve and display space-related images from a NASA API endpoint:

`https://images-api.nasa.gov/searchq={searchInput}`

The dependencies for this project are React, Node.js and axios.

Desktop UI:

<img src="/src/images/desktop-screenshot.png?" alt="desktop screenshot"/>

Mobile UI:

<img src="/src/images/mobile-screenshot.png?" alt="mobile screenshot"/>

The brief for this test was to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space.

## Installation

Navigate to the desired directory in your terminal and run: 

`https://github.com/JordsCodes/tech-test`

Install Node Project Manager:

`npm install`

## Usage

To start the app, navigate to the app's root directory and run: 

`npm start`

The user can search for strictly space-related images. The images will be displayed in either 1, 2, or 3 columns depending on the width of the viewport.

## Notes

Given additional time, I would have liked to make the app more responsive to different screen layouts. I would also alter the way the data is destructured to allow for more appropriate alternative descriptions for each of the rendered images.
